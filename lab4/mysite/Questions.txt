Q 4

Migrations are a way of activating changes made at INSTALLED_APPS 
in settings.py and creates any database tables accordingly. 

Q 5 

You see the a Authentication and Authorization menu
And a POLLS menu with the option choices and questions

In the admin.py file you can add custom models by importing them first.
Then implement them on the page by admin.site.register(your_model)
This will make your custom model to show up on the admin page.


Q 6 

i see the text that is returned from polls/views.py
so /poll/38/ shows You're looking at question 38
    /polls/38/results shows You're looking at the results of question 38
and /poll/38/vote shows You're voting on question 38

An error appears when you dont put a number since the path specifies that it must be of type int.
If you specify the user input to be of type string it can accept any alphabet character.

Q 7

It is bad because if you hardcode urls, then if you need to change a url, you will have
to go through all your code and change them manually at every instance of where that url is used. 



Q 8 
The benefits of using generic views is that you can easily place data you want to 
displayed in a template rather than having to write them yourself.
You should not use a generic view when you want to display a highly customized html 
code.
